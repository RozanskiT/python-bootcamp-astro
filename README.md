# Python bootcamp for astronomers

During four four-hour meetings, we will cover the basics of programming in Python using Jupyter notebooks. In the following meetings, you will learn:

- Fundamentals of programming and Python syntax, including variables, operators, functions, conditional statements, and loops.
- Input/output statements and the basics of object-oriented programming in Python (including exercises).
- The numpy library for numerical computations and the matplotlib library for creating plots.
- The scipy library for scientific computations, including optimization, interpolation, signal processing, and linear algebra. We will also cover the pandas library for working with tabular data and the astropy library, which provides tools for astronomers.
